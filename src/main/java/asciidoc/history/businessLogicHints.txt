1. Use businessID instead of DB technicalID
technicalID - Long
business values - Strings or primitives

2. Use custom Exceptions instead of standard
EntityNotFoundException - extends RuntimeException - unchecked

3. Get = read, Post = insert, Put = update all fields, Patch = update one field, Delete = delete
